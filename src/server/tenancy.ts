 * Ownership checks for IDs that arrive from the browser.

 * Every record belongs to one practice. An action that takes an ID from a

 * another's claims and patients by sending a different ID. Missing and
 * foreign records get the same "not found" so the response does not reveal
 * whether an ID exists elsewhere.
