/**
 * The band below the hero, where a SaaS landing page usually puts a customer
 * logo wall.
 *
 * It names organization types rather than organizations. Putting a real
 * hospital's mark here would claim an endorsement that does not exist, use a
 * trademark without permission, and mislead both prospects and the investors
 * the neighbouring page is written for. When there are customers willing to be
 * named, their marks replace this and the claim becomes true.
 *
 * The payer line underneath is a capability claim, not an affiliation: the
 * platform generates 837P claims addressed to these payer IDs, which is a fact
 * about the software rather than a relationship with the payer.

            The platform generates 837P claims with the payer IDs for Medicare Part B, state Medicaid
            programs and the major commercial plans, and posts their 835 remittances. Live submission
            to payers runs through a connected clearinghouse.
