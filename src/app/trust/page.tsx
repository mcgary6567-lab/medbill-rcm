            AI is off until a practice connects its own Anthropic account. When on, denial explanations and appeal drafts are written from codes only (CARC, RARC, CPT, ICD-10, payer type);
            patient names, dates of birth, member IDs and addresses are filled in by our servers after the AI answers. Import column matching sends column headers and the shape of values, never the values.
            Questions asked of the report builder send the question and the practice&apos;s payer and provider names, never report results.
            Coding from full visit notes and reading insurance card photos, which contain patient information, stay off unless the practice confirms it has a BAA with Anthropic.
