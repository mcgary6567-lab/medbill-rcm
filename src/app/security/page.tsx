          <h2>HIPAA alignment</h2>
          <p>
            A practice using the platform is the covered entity; we are its business associate. A
            business associate agreement is available on request and is signed before any protected
            health information is loaded. It sets out what we may do with protected health information,
            how long we keep it, and what happens to it when the relationship ends. The technical
            safeguards above map to the Security Rule: access control, audit controls, integrity and
            transmission security.
          </p>

          <h2>Standards we implement</h2>
          <p>
            Claims and remittances are generated and parsed as real ASC X12 transactions rather than
            passed through a conversion layer: 837P for professional claims, 835 for remittance
            advice, 270 and 271 for eligibility, and 999 and 277CA acknowledgments; EHR and lab
            traffic is HL7 v2. Each is covered by segment-level tests, so a change that would alter a
            segment fails before it ships.
          </p>

          <h2>Reporting a vulnerability</h2>
